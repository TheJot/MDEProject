# 6CCS3MDE Project: GenerateMe DSML


## About
GenerateMe is an Xtext based DSML for creating simple yet effective business websites based on Bootstrap without having to code know either Bootstrap itself or any other web-development techniques.
By utilizing prinicples of domain-specific modelling languages we could reduce the complexity of the code as well as amount of knowledge required to create a simple website that can provide the potential with all the informations and functionalities that they need to encoruage them to try our services.

Project is mainly based on simplicity; GenerateMe doesn't require its user to know anything about web development, apart from optional basic of HTML for formatting text, making it a much more cost-efficient alternative to often very expensive costs of web-designing services.


## Requirements
In order to use GenerateMe the following software is required:
* Eclipse IDE for Java
* Java SE 8+
* XPect
* XSemantics
* Xtext


## Language download and setup
In order to download & run GenerateMe you need to import this repository and create a new .gme within the runtime eclipse:
1. Start your Eclipse
2. Right-click in the Package Explorer and go to _Import -> Project from Git -> Clone URL_, paste repo's URL and go _Next -> Next -> Finish_
3. Right-click on package _uk.juliusz.generateme_ and go to _Run As -> Eclipse Application_
4. In the Runtime Eclipse go to TestGenerateMe -> src -> Example-MemorablePhotography.gme in order to access the example website
5. You can find the source code of the example website, or any website generated by yourself later on in the _src-gen_ folder.
Repository has already all the settings that you need, therefore no further changes to the setup shall be required.
In case of any compilation errors make sure that the project is set to use **Java 1.8** which proved itself the most compatible with the set of tools mentioned above.


## Deployment of the website
In order to deploy the website you need to upload content of the _src-gen_ folder including the _images_ folder onto a web-server.

For testing purposes the example website has been deployed under link: http://mde.juliusz.uk/

You can utilize the hosting provided for your own purpose by using _FileZilla_ and logging in with credentials below:
```
Host: ftp.server739883.nazwa.pl
Login: server739883_mde
Password: MDEM4gic!
```


## Structure of a website
### Initial definitions 
Each website must at least consits of a _Home Page_ and declaration of the _Business Name_, as per the example above.
Both of these can be defined only once and have to be the first elements in the source file.

Contant of the Home Page needs to be defined within curly brackets and consist of 2 elements:
* Page Header - Header visible above the introduction
* Introduction - Brief introduction into the business and the website itself.

```
BusinessName 'Memorable Photography'

HomePage{
PageHeader 'Welcome to Memorable Photography!'
Introduction 'Qam eros pellentesque quam, nec pulvinar purus nunc ut est. Phasellus interdum at mi.'
}
```

### Pages
There are 3 types of pages that we can utilize in order to create a website:
* Content Page
* Gallery Page
* Contact Page

There is no limit to the number of pages of each type that can be used in a single website.


#### Content Page
Content Page will be the most commonly used type of the page, as it's dedicated for displaying text-based contant to the user.

After declaring a type of the page as being _Content Page_, choosing a suitable name and declaring its _Page Header_ we can proceed to create _Sections_ of text.
Each section consists of a _Title_ and its _Content_, defined as per the example below.
Number of sections on a single page is not limited, page will autmatically resize according to its content.

```
ContentPage About{
	PageHeader 'About us'
	Section Section1{
		Title 'Where do we come from?'
		Content'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse molestie mauris.'
	}
	Section Section2{
		Title 'What do we do?'
		Content 'Sed vehicula rhoncus gravida. Cras consectetur, neque pharetra pretium blandit.'
	}
	Section Section3{
		Title 'How can we help you?'
		Content 'Nullam porta bibendum nunc, id pretium sem blandit nec. Integer luctus, lectus id rhoncus.'
	}
	}
```


#### Gallery Page
Gallery page is designed to display a series of images to the user.

It consists of a series of _Photos_ which need to be individually defined by their _Name, PhotoDescription_ and _PhotoFileName_ along with its extension.
Photos need to be stored in the _images_ folder of the generated code.

Number of images on a single gallery page is unlimited; page will automatically resize them to a suitable resolution.

```
GalleryPage Nature{
	Photo Flowers{
		PhotoDescription 'This is a photo of flowers'
		PhotoFileName 'flowers.jpg'
	}
	
	
	Photo Forest{
		PhotoDescription 'This is a photo of a forest.'
		PhotoFileName 'forest.jpg'
	}
	
	Photo Reindeer{
		PhotoDescription 'This is a photo of a reindeer.'
		PhotoFileName 'animal.jpg'
	}
}

```


#### Contact Page
Contact Page consists of a contact form allowing the user to e-mail the business directly.
There is no limit of how many contant pages can be declared for a single website, therefore you might wish to have separate ones for different departments.

In order to configure the contact script we need to define _PageHeader_ as well as _SendFrom_ and _Send To_ addresses, where:
* SendFrom address should be an e-mail address on the same domain as the website
* SendTo should be a mailbox which will receive the e-mails sent from the form

**SendFrom** does not require SMTP Auth., therefore SendFrom address doesn't need to be an actual mailbox, however for spam filtering purposes should be on the same domain, otherwise your e-mail might be rejected by the recipient.
Your web hosting **should** have a fully operational mail server attached to its own IP as well as the domain name, otherwise your e-mails might be rejected.

Example site deployed in the link below meets all of these criteria.

```
ContactPage Contact{
	PageHeader 'Send us an e-mail!'
	SendFrom 'hello@juliusz.uk'
	SendTo 'julek175j@gmail.com'
	}
```


## Validation and autocomplete
_GenerateMe_ has a fully operational autocomplete embedded thanks to facilities provided by Xtext.
In order to utilize it in Eclipse IDE press _CTRL + SPACE_ to receive a proposed autocomplete.

Number of validations and QuickFixes have been implemented, these include:
* Ensure that names for _Pages, Sections and Photos_ start with a capital
* Ensure that file names for _Photos_ are inclusive of their extensions
* Ensure that from and to addresses for the _Contact Pages_ are in correct formats 


## Example
An example code for a photography business would look as following:

_NOTE: Content fillers reduced for clarity._

```
BusinessName 'Memorable Photography'


HomePage{
PageHeader 'Welcome to Memorable Photography!'
Introduction 'Qam eros pellentesque quam, nec pulvinar purus nunc ut est. Phasellus interdum at mi.'
